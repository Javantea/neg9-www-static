### IRC

We have a public IRC channel on the EFNet network.

* **Network:** EFNet
* **Channel:** #neg9

This channel is bridged to a semi-public Discord server as well, so you'll see a bot in there. Let us know if you'd prefer to be on Discord natively and we can get you an invite.

### Mailing Lists

_**Note:** Currently mailing lists are down, but we plan to have them back up in the future._

~~We host several mailing lists for general discussion, announcements, and local discussion. They are all hosted in the form of listname@neg9.org.~~

~~You may sign up through the web interface (via the provided Mailman link) or by sending mail to listname-subscribe@neg9.org.~~

* ~~**List:** hackers~~
* ~~**[Mailman Page][1]**~~
