The Neg9 CTF Team participated this past weekend in [Boston Key Party 2015](http://bostonkey.party/). We had a great time competing in this competition that featured diverse and challenging problems. Ultimately, out of the 828 teams that scored points, Neg9 finished in 20th place with 3345 points.

Thanks to all that played and to the game organizers. Watch this space for some writeups of the challenges we solved.
