Blackhat USA and DEFCON 18 are this weekend, and over a dozen Neg9 members will be attending! We'll be releasing our new shirts at DEFCON (a limited number of them will be available for purchase) and competing in several of the competitions. DEFCON is always a great time, and we look forward to having another killer year! See you there!

We've added a meta-meeting for all Neg9 groups to attend during DEFCON on Thursday evening around 20:00hrs, so that people from the different areas can meet each other and hang out. Meeting details will be posted on the Meetings page, check it for up-to-date details!
