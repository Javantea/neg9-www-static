If you're arriving here from [isiOS7jailbrokenyet.com](http://isiOS7jailbrokenyet.com) welcome! If not
you should go check out the project and come back - we'll wait.

I thought it'd be a good idea to write a post about why Neg9 donated/is
donating to the project and to talk a bit about who we are and how you
can get involved if you're so inclined.

I think this type of project is a great way to reward security
researchers without forcing them to sell their exploits on the black
market. This model allows interested parties (us) to donate to a project
we care about. We can donate as much or as little as the solution is
worth to us and if the pot gets big enough it may start to be worth a
professional security researcher's time. I believe with our donation the
pot will break $10,000, which is some fair scratch if I do say so
myself.

I have faith in the model, because it's backed by some great folks of
whom I respect and also selling vulns is a pain in the ass, honestly.

Jailbreaking iOS7 is hugely important, not only for hackers, but for
builders, end users and people who care about freedom to do with the
hardware and software they've purchased as they see fit.

The way hardware and software manufacturers have attempted to disallow
us from running the software we want on the hardware we own is just
plain wrong. It makes verifying the security of the software that does
run on the device difficult, it stops innovation, and stifles choice.
Like usual the [EFF](https://eff.org) has done a much better job articulating why the
[DMCA needs to be fixed](http://fixthedmca.org/).

**Who we are**

Neg9 is a group of like-minded hackers, breakers, builders, and friends
who like to share knowledge about breaking and building, meet up and
drink beers, go to conferences and [participate in a CTF or two](https://ctftime.org/team/303).

If you're interested in joining we'd love to have you participate in our
open hackers mailing list. On that list we frequently discuss all kinds
of interesting computery topics that will probably interest you if
you've read this far down.

If you want more information about us check out the [about page](https://neg9.org/about/) or if
you want to sign up for the mailing list check out the [communicate
page](https://neg9.org/communicate/)
