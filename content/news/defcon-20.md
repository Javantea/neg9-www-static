Neg9 members made a ruckus in Vegas this past weekend at Defcon 20. Overall, Neg9 scored a win in Hacker Jeopardy (three-way tie with zero points, but we had the best zero points of them all), a second place win in BroCTF (after ignoring the game all of Friday and Saturday and only playing for four hours on Sunday), lots of schnanigans and covering every surface possible with Neg9 stickers.

Thanks to all of the Defcon organizers and Goons for a great weekend. Watch this space for a more detailed writeup of the events once everybody sobers up.
