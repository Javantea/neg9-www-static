DEFCON 18 was a most excellent DEFCON! There were next to no problems, Priest even called it the calmest DEFCON ever - wow! Good stuff, it made for a great year.

Neg9 participated (and came in 3rd place) in the [TubeWarriors](http://tubewarriors.org/) oCTF this year, and it was overall quite enjoyable. It was their first year organizing the competition, and with that they did quite a good job. Of course there were kinks here and there, and we may be bitter about a few things - but we're mostly hopeful for next year.

Neg9 was the only team to root one of the game machines, which was great fun - a full write-up for that is available here: [TubeWarriors DEFCON 18 oCTF "2speed" Local Root Exploit](https://neg9.org/wiki/DC18-oCTF-2speed-local-root)

We'll continue practicing and finding good people for our team - next year maybe we'll see you at oCTF as well as ddtek's CTF - at the Rio hotel!
