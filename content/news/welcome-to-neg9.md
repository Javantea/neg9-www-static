Negative Nine Security is a geographically dispersed organisation of security professionals/enthusiasts, coders, hobbyists, tinkerers and all around hackers.

We aim to hold periodic (at least monthly) meetings in the various regions where we have a presence - with the following as some of the goals for those meetings:

- Share knowledge via presentations and round-table discussions - generally technical and security or development related.

- Organise security challenges and puzzles for everyone to play (similar to DEF CON CTF qualifications, for example.)

- Encourage new & young people to get in to the hacking scene and raise interest in software security.
