While this summer seems to have been packed with conferences and hacker events, Neg9 members aren't ready to let go of conference season just yet. October brings with it two more conferences featuring presentations by Neg9 members.

At the OWASP Global AppSec Latin America 2011 Conference in Brazil, Marcus Hodges (meta) will be presenting "Highly concurrent Python for brute force and discovery" on Friday, October 7 @ 10:00. This will be a longer and more in-depth presentation centered around [Black Mamba](http://rootfoo.org/blackmamba) and geared towards the OWASP folks.

At ToorCon San Diego, Tom Samstag (tecknicaltom) will be presenting "push %ebp" on Sunday, October 9, 2011 @ 18:30. This presentation will detail a technique for dynamic stack analysis for use in
situations where stack contents can be extracted but access to the vulnerable executable is not available.

As in past years, many Neg9 members will be in attendance at Toorcon. Hope you make it out to one of these great conferences!
