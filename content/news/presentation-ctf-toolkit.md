On Wednesday, April 15, 2015, Neg9 members meta and tecknicaltom gave a presentation to Batman's Kitchen, the University of Washington's CTF team. The talk was titled "CTF Toolkit". The goal was to present to the students and CTF players a whirlwind tour of some of the most common tools used during CTFs.
