The Neg9.org website is now in much better shape. All links should work, and we now display upcoming and recent meetings so it's easy to find out about meetings in your area. Information about mailing lists, SILC, and IRC have been added to the communicate section.

We still haven't decided what to do in regard to Forums and other potential apps, more to come on that later!
