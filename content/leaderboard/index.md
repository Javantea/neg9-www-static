The _Neg9 Leaderboard_ is a very popular directory of hacking, reverse-engineering, cryptography, engineering, and numerous other challenges that lets users track their progress and have some friendly competition among peers to motivate each other and keep their skills sharp.

Stay tuned for a new and improved version of the infamous _Neg9 Leaderboard_!

### List of Challenge Sites
